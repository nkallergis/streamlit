### **Professional services architect at [UniSystems](https://www.unisystems.gr/)**
*November 2019 - present*  

As a result of the below and in conjunction with the experience I've gathered from all my previous positions, my title was changed to "Architect". Along with it, my main focus has also shifted mostly towards automation/orchestration and cloud projects for large entities (EU institutions, banks, public sector). In short, I'm spending more time in front of VSCode and Azure portal instead of SecureCRT and WireShark.

### **Senior network engineer at [UniSystems](https://www.unisystems.gr/)**
*July 2017 - October 2019*  

After given a great opportunity, I became part of the Professional Services Network Team of UniSystems. My primary role was to execute projects for EU institutions (data centres refreshes, IP telephony installations, security assessments, firewall upgrades, you name it). In the meantime, serious time was invested in bringing my automation toolset and cloud skills to an acceptable level. This in turn resulted in my participation in the grand project of migrating a whole EU agency to Microsoft's Azure public cloud while in parallel transforming their infrastructure to infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

### **Senior network engineer at [InTTrust SA](https://www.inttrust.gr/)**
*April 2016 - June 2017*  

Roughly 70% of my time was consumed on providing L2/L3 network support and designs but after 10 years of working solely on networks, it was time that I expanded my skillset to a fuller stack. Thus, the remaining 30% of my time was about gearing up on Microsoft skills along with storage, backup & virtualization technologies. On the long run, I tried to sharpen my NetOps-Fu by reframing my developer skills under a network automation/orchestration perspective.

### **IP telephony engineer at [CBS](https://www.cbs.gr/)**
*March 2016 - April 2016*  

For two months I went back to my roots and worked as Cisco IP Telephony field engineer.

### **Network presales & design engineer at [CBS](https://www.cbs.gr/)**
*April 2010 - February 2016*  

Even though I was hired as a Network presales engineer, my duties spread overtime to cover a wider span. My main occupation was to design and architect network solutions but an approximate 30% of my work time was dedicated to other engagements: given my past experience, I undertook several technical projects as senior field engineer. Moreover, I was assigned the position of Technical Manager for the area of Cyprus and I was part of the Business Development team of the company. Finally, sometimes I backed up sales people as my then boss identified an emerging talent for sales in me (?).

### **Network field engineer at SyNET SA**
*November 2005 - December 2008*  

While working for SyNET, I got a lot more experienced in field work. As the certifications indicate, I became specialized in IP Telephony (Cisco UCM & UCME), routing, switching and wireless infrastructures. I also got a good glimpse of Cisco's security technologies of the time.

### **Network support at [Hellenic Petroleum](https://www.helpe.gr/en/)**
*April 2005 -  October 2005*  

I was a member of the IT Support help desk as part of my 6 months practice. My main responsibilities were to maintain the network (add new equipment, new users), VLAN provisioning, fine tuning routing protocols and security. The most interesting project I undertook was to import the whole network infrastructure into HP's OpenView NMS - that along with writing several SNMP driver enhancements for "stray" equipment...
